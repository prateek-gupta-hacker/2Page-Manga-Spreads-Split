Simple script to run in the linux terminal to split those horrible scans where they scanned both pages at once from old out of print manga.  Can be used for other books and things too, feel free to tweak.  You can rename this 2page then copy this to /usr/bin/ and sudo chmod a+x and then you can navigate to any bad-manga-scans folder and run 2page and it'll fix it.  This exports to a new folder so if it messes something up your old files are intact.  I'm very very new to this and hoping to get better pls be gentle and if I made a dumb mistake tell me.  

I don't mind people editing and reusing this, my code is caveman level (although it works) so you can probably do better.
